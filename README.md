Syntax for usage:

This program includes both the MatrixSolver source files and a companion program
titled "run.sh".

Executing "run.sh" both makes the program and automatically
redirects the contents of the local file "data.txt" to the compiled program.

Once compiled, if you would like, it can be fed data either from
the keyboard (Be warned, prompts have been disabled) or by redirecting a
file with the redirect command like so:
$ MatrixSolver < data.txt

Expected Data.txt format:

2

1 2

3 4

10

20
